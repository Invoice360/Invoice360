# Invoice360

Vision<br />
Invoice 360 Cloud Sync is a free and open-source invoice system that supports cloud syncing and easy self-cloud-hosting. The app can operate locally on a device without a network connection and syncs data with the cloud when a connection is available. The server cloud is kept as simple as possible for ease of self-hosting without requiring tedious maintenance. 

Project <br />
This project aims to provide a simple yet complete invoice system for small business owners based on an existing and popular invoicing app, <a href=http://www.invoicesoftware360.com>Invoice 360</a> (Please note that the current version in the Store works on local data only.) available in the Windows Store. You can follow the instructions provided here and self-host the server cloud on Microsoft Azure and make use of the syncing capabilities. Since this project is open-source, it is also possible for independent developers to extend the capabilities of the system.
